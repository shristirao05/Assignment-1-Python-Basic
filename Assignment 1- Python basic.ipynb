    "Question 1:  What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Python is a computer programming language that is used to build websites, apps, games, do data analysis, and much more. It is very easy to understand because its code looks like normal English, which makes it beginner-friendly.\n",
    "It is popular because it can be used in many areas like web development, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science. Also, Python has a huge collection of free tools and libraries, which saves time for programmers. Its simple syntax and strong community support make it one of the top choices for coders around the world."

    "Question 2: What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "An interpreter in Python is a special program that reads and runs the Python code line by line. It checks one line at a time and shows the result immediately. If there’s a mistake in any line, it stops right there and shows an error.\n",
    "This makes it easy for beginners to test and fix their code quickly, which is one reason why learning Python feels simple and smooth."

    "\n",
    "Answer: \n",
    "Pre-defined keywords in Python are special words that have a fixed meaning and use in the language. For example, words like if, for, while, True, and def are keywords. We can't change their meaning, and they are used to write code correctly."
